      "longDescription": "AlphIQ is designed to synthesize information, not just present it. The real challenge in Web3 isn’t finding data; it’s the cognitive burden of connecting disparate points: a transaction, a wallet’s history, a contract’s function, and a community campaign — into a single, understandable narrative. AlphIQ does that heavy lifting for you, weaving the data into a story and giving you a central role to play.",
